# News-Topic-Prediction
Classifiers for predicting news topics

* There are two classifier models within this project, one of them being logistic regression and another one being deep learning. These classifiers are trained to identify and predict topics of news articles.
* I observed that the deep learning model performs better.
* Iâ€™m using the AG's News Topic Classification Dataset (http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html).
* It is in a CSV format and contains three columns: title, description, and topic.
